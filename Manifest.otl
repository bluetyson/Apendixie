TODO Actions
	[_] Doors
		: Doors can be places with @tun/door of @door command.
		: This creates an exit which can be openned of closed. I cannot be
		: traversed unless open. The problem is that the commands only work on
		: one side of the door at a time. To fix this I belive I have to
		: rewrite the @tunnel command to use create_exit and link the two
		: sides of the door (two diff exits) at creation time.
	[_] Play Stormer help:
		: Mostly just helpful prompts to let them play how I've already been
		: playing.
		: But also some critical tools like the editor
		[_] General Help
			: help via a command
		[_] Enable Editor in several commands.
			: either overload desc maybe by adding a switch, or create a
			: ans @edesc command to "edit descriptions"
		[_] Start comand
			: instructions to please start by digging an exit with your own
			: name to your first room. Then start on Table V.
		[_] Some Place desc
			: let the default text of a tun destination be a reminder to roll
			: on Table I
		[_] Door rules
			: explain how to implement doors.
		[_] Directional Advice
			: left right what?
	[_] Automagic:
		
	[X] Die roller
		: works as ordered!
	[X] Tables
		: All the Appendix A tables are now available in game with the 
		: "table" command. It is possible to override the die roll in advance.
		: Another interesting over ride would be to simply print out every
		: result.
	[_] Menus for Tables
		: This would replace or be an alternative to the table commands,
		: instead of passing arguments to table, the command would open up a
		: menu that let you choose from the tables. Ideal for leading ppl
		: through the various linked tables. BUT... difficult with manual
		: building.
	[_] Building Commands/guide
		: Add a building command field to each table result, So that after
		: rolling. The table would suggest an Evennia building command and
		: proper arguments to implement the suggestion from the table.
	[_] Auto-build prompt
		: When showing the suggested command, prompt the player to accept the
		: suggestion, implementing it
		: immediately.commands.default.muxcommand.MuxCommand. 
Post Appendixie
	: Down the road I'd like to transition to a new game based on this idea
	: of random building and adventuring in tandem.
talk is cheap
	New objects
		new_exit
			: new_exits are objects that look like exits until traversed, then
			: they will spawn a random node
			: new_exits have attributes which dictate constraints on the
			: random node.
		random_node
			: random nodes are created  following the constraints set by the
			: new_exit that called it.
			: note: random_nodes will typically have at least one normal exit
			: (linking back through the new-exit that called it) and zero or
			: more new new_exits
			:wq

	POC
		: The simplest proof of concept has to be a random room generating
		: script DungeonMaster like Griatch suggested - table 1 perhaps?
		: I don't know. Nothing is easy.
		:
		: Perhaps the first step is simply to to a cardinal direction
		: generator.
		:
		: Not really, exits are the first step
	Exits and Doors
		: All movement in this Evennia dungeon is conducted via exit objects.
		: So, probably all the random rolls will occur within exit objects.
		: So the game will be based around a custom exit typeclass.
		:
		: Perhaps the exit triggers a builder bot that populates new rooms
		: with random features including of course additional special exits
		: etc.
		:
		: No need a new object type - that looks like an exit or a room but
		: triggers the correct 
	Objects
		: hmm
