		new_exit
			: new_exits are objects that look like exits until traversed, then
			: they will spawn a random node
			: new_exits have attributes which dictate constraints on the
			: random node.
		random_node
			: random nodes are created  following the constraints set by the
			: new_exit that called it.
			: note: random_nodes will typically have at least one normal exit
			: (linking back through the new-exit that called it) and zero or

	POC
		: The simplest proof of concept has to be a random room generating
		: script DungeonMaster like Griatch suggested - table 1 perhaps?
		: I don't know. Nothing is easy.
		:
		: Perhaps the first step is simply to to a cardinal direction
		: generator.
		:
		: Not really, exits are the first step
	Exits and Doors
		: All movement in this Evennia dungeon is conducted via exit objects.
		: So, probably all the random rolls will occur within exit objects.
		: So the game will be based around a custom exit typeclass.
		:
		: Perhaps the exit triggers a builder bot that populates new rooms
		: with random features including of course additional special exits
		: etc.
		:
		: No need a new object type - that looks like an exit or a room but
		: triggers the correct
