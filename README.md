# Welcome to Apendixie!
Apendixie is based on the Appendix A of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons
Dungeon Master Guide by Gary Gygax (1979). Appendix A is a set of tables that
purported to allow you to create random dungeons, populated with tricks, traps,
treasure, and monsters. The whole thing is available online at Wizards of the
Coast here: https://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/excerpts/excerpt_dmg4.pdf

This game replicates Appendix A, down to its typos and quirky punctuation (as
best as I was able). By using the "table" command in-game you can reference
authentic random results from the old DMG while making your building decisions.

If you have read this far, and are kind enough to participate---I wouldn't call
it 'play testing' more like 'play-storming'. By all means log in and create a
character.

# Development plan
Manifest.otl contains the latest actual plans and ideas. However I may use the
wiki as well to flesh out ideas.  In particular for the future game based on
the idea contained in this one.
